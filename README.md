# clustering-music-preferences
An analysis of how music preferences influence social impact using clustering (k-means, GMM), PCA, and regression. Identifies distinct listener groups and examines their influence scores. Project done in R for the Machine Learning for Social Science course.

Project Overview
Using unsupervised learning and regression analysis, this project explored how individuals' music preferences influence social influence. Clustering techniques like k-means and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) were used to identify distinct groups based on genre preferences, such as jazz, pop, and hiphop.


Key Methods
- Scatter plots to visualize initial groupings
- Elbow method and BIC for determining optimal number of clusters
- K-means and GMM for clustering individuals based on taste
- Linear regression to examine how influence varies across clusters and by genre preference
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Sparse PCA for dimensionality reduction and interpretability

Findings
The analysis revealed that clusters of individuals showed distinctive preferences—jazz lovers, pop fans, and a neutral/hiphop group. Regression results confirmed that musical taste statistically impacts a person's influence score, with jazz and hiphop having the strongest effects. PCA identified dominant components shaped by socioeconomic indicators and genre preferences, while sparse PCA enhanced interpretability by highlighting a few key variables per component.
